Windows application providing a toolkit for properly formatting and annotating security incident imagery according to RSOC formatting standards. Previously, employees would use Microsoft Word or PowerPoint to do this, which was a tedious process of manually adding and formatting all visual elements that resulted in frequent errors and wasted time. The objective of this project was to streamline this process of creating imagery used in incident reports and other documentation, leading to more timely and accurate report generation. Developed using Microsoft Visual Studio, C#, and the Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) template.
